# Logging
Logging(Module) means keeping a record of things that happen when a program runs.
It is a standard library in python.

Instead of just using print(), you can use logging to:


1.Save messages to files.

2.Turn logging on or off easily.


# Why Not Use print()

print() is good for simple debugging, but:


## Print():
1. Only shows in console

2. Hard to filter

3. No timestamps


## logging():

1. Can write to files, emails, etc.
2. Can filter by message level
3. Timestamps included
4. Customizable formats

## logging levels:

DEBUG	
WARNING	
ERROR	
CRITICAL
